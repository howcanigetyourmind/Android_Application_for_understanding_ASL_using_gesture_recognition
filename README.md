## -We communicate with you-

More than 100 million deaf people around the world communicate in sign language. Sign language provides relatively accurate and abundant means of communication to deaf people and people around them, but it is still impossible to communicate with people who do not know sign language. In order to facilitate communication between signers and non-users, sign language interpreters using machine learning are provided. Sign language motion will be output by voice after recognition, voice will be recognized and printed by video of sign language motion and will make communication more convenient for deaf people.
